# 🛠️ The 7 Pillars Practitioner Templates

**Framework:** The 7 Pillars of Optimization™  
**Purpose:** Operationalizing the framework for daily publishing workflows.

---

## Welcome to the Practitioner Layer

The documents in this folder are designed to take The 7 Pillars of Optimization™ from a strategic philosophy into an executable, daily standard. 

While the canonical white paper dictates **what** must be optimized, these templates dictate **how** you optimize it—specifically, how you resolve the natural tension between machine-readable structure and human-readable narrative.

### The 3 Core Artifacts

1. **`pillar-scorecard-template.md`**
   * **What it is:** A pre-publish checklist ensuring all seven pillars have been addressed.
   * **When to use it:** During final editorial review before hitting "Publish."
   * **Critical Rule:** This document enforces the **HEO Veto**. If the content fails the Human Ethics Optimization check (e.g., manipulative claims, lack of AI disclosure), the piece cannot be published, even if it passes the other six pillars.

2. **`cross-pillar-tension-log.md`**
   * **What it is:** A documentation tool to record where optimizing for one pillar conflicted with another (e.g., making a sentence short for AI ingestion ruined the narrative flow for humans), and how you resolved it.
   * **When to use it:** During the drafting and structuring phases.
   * **Critical Rule:** Use this to train new team members on how to apply the "Dual-Lane Strategy" (satisfying machines in one section, and humans in another).

3. **`dual-lane-publishing-spec.md`**
   * **What it is:** Your content contract. It separates the page requirements into the **Machine Lane** (metadata, schema, extractable summaries) and the **Human Lane** (narrative, proof-of-action, ethical disclosures).
   * **When to use it:** During the outlining and ideation phase, *before* drafting begins.

## 📋 Recommended Operating Workflow

To effectively use these templates, we recommend the following 4-step workflow for every high-value piece of content:

### Step 1: Duplicate & Plan
* Duplicate the `dual-lane-publishing-spec.md` template.
* Define your Machine Lane (what facts the AI needs to extract).
* Define your Human Lane (what story and proof the human needs to trust you).

### Step 2: Draft
* Write the content. 
* Ensure your "Bottom Line Up Front" (BLUF) and AI-targeted snippets are formatted cleanly (un-nested bullets, strict H2s).
* Build your narrative and embed your lived-experience evidence below the extraction layers.

### Step 3: Resolve Tensions
* If you hit a roadblock where SEO/GEO requirements are making the content robotic, or where Human Storytelling is making the content un-crawlable, open the `cross-pillar-tension-log.md`.
* Document the conflict and apply a Dual-Lane resolution (e.g., keeping a strict definition at the top, but expanding with a metaphor further down).

### Step 4: Final Review & The HEO Veto
* Duplicate the `pillar-scorecard-template.md`.
* Grade the draft against all seven pillars.
* Verify your ethical boundaries, disclosures, and autonomy safeguards. 
* Approve for publishing.

### ⚠️ A Note on Examples

If you are looking at completed versions of these documents for reference, please note that **all examples are strictly illustrative**. They are meant to demonstrate the *process* of practitioner optimization. 

The canonical authority on pillar definitions and scope always remains the primary [7 Pillars of Optimization White Paper](../docs/7-pillars-optimization-whitepaper.md).
